# Sustainable energy development - exploratory data analysis
## Project Overview
This project explores sustainable energy development with a focus on Poland and Western Europe, and then expands the analysis to a global scale across different continents. The analysis investigates energy trends, access to electricity, and CO2 emissions to gain insights into the relationship between economic growth, energy consumption, and the shift toward low-carbon energy.
